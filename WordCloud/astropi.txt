In this project, our goal was to receive the vegetation of the sea and therefore locate Coral reefs ,seaweed and other vegetation in the sea, This could help in the field of science because Coral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine environment, including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and hundreds of other species. Scientists estimate that there may be millions of undiscovered species of organisms living in and around reefs.
After doing research on these topics, our team concluded that with the hardware, resources we had available, investigating parameters such as Rasters, Clouds and sensing sea was the best way to gather useful data.
After reading and analyzing several studies about coral reefs and its importance, we decided to use just the NIR camera on the AstroPiâ€™s SenseHAT, as it can receive the NDVI data(Normalized Difference Vegetation index) with this we could reach our goal.Our code expectations are to find if it is night or not, if the picture has sea or not, if the picture is cloudy or not, and to find the vegetation using NDVI. We then stored all this data in a .csv file. Our previous idea was to find the volume of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We were figuring this our using the gas wavelengths using spectroscopy but on the astro pi izzy there is only a NIR camera but our wavelength ranges exceed the limitations.
We calculated the average greyscale value and then if it was higher than 40 then we know it is night so we can delete the image. We did the same process with finding if the sea was present in the picture or not, but this time we analyzed the blue value.
